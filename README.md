Python Challenge

For this challenge, we were asked to complete one of two challenges. Instructions for the specific projects are below. 

Getting Started:

import pandas as pd 

PyPoll: 

In this challenge, you are tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process. (Up until now, Uncle Cleetus had been trustfully tallying them one-by-one, but unfortunately, his concentration isn't what it used to be.)

You will be given two sets of poll data (election_data_1.csv and election_data_2.csv). Each dataset is composed of three columns: Voter ID, County, and Candidate. Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:


1. The total number of votes cast
2. A complete list of candidates who received votes
3. The percentage of votes each candidate won
4. The total number of votes each candidate won
5. The winner of the election based on popular vote.


PyParagraph:

In this challenge, you get to play the role of chief linguist at a local learning academy. As chief linguist, you are responsible for assessing the complexity of various passages of writing, ranging from the sophomoric Twilight novel to the nauseatingly high-minded research article. Having read so many passages, you've since come up with a fairly simple set of metrics for assessing complexity.

Your task is to create a Python script to automate the analysis of any such passage using these metrics. Your script will need to do the following:


Import a text file filled with a paragraph of your choosing.

Assess the passage for each of the following:


Approximate word count
Approximate sentence count
Approximate letter count (per word)
Average sentence length (in words)
